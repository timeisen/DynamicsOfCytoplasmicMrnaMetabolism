This repo is organized into four directories. The main code for running the exponential model 
and the model for fitting tail length kinetics is in the TailKineticsModels folder.
Additional preprocessing code is available in the KinetTlnAnalysis folder. Figure generating scripts
are available in the KinetTlnFigures folder.
